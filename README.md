GradeMate : Automated Assessment of Descriptive Responses using Large Language Model
GradeMate is a locally deployable tool that uses a large language model (LLM), specifically Mistral , to evaluate descriptive answers in academic settings. It mimics human-like grading based on rubric-driven evaluation, offering scores and constructive feedback in real-time — completely offline.
